# GreenViewIndex-JohorBahru
 
## Aim:
To analyze the state of urban green coverage in Malaysian city from the users' perspective with Green View Index (GVI). 

## Objectives: 
1. To collect and process street view images data to measure urban green coverage from the perspective of human users. 
2. To compute GVI effectively from street view images with pixel value segmentation and supervised machine learning models. 
3. To develop a dashboard to visualize the estimated GVI of selected sites and assess the distribution of green views in Malaysian city.
